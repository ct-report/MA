Contact Tracing - Morocco

**WIQAYTNA** - It's a BT proximity-tracing solution, that is based on a fork of [OpenTrace](https://github.com/ct-report/OPENTRACE) = decentralised proximity data collection (device) + centralised contact tracing/match (backend).

It requires the mobile-phone number registration as a measure to prevent abuse & ease contacts. Only Moroccan numbers are allowed.
